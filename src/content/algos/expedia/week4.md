## Week 4 as a SWE Intern at Expedia - Hackathon Week

I didn’t write much this week because I took part in the Hackathon organized by Expedia. I’ll likely share more about it in a dedicated post, where I’ll talk about the event and reflect on my experience participating in my very first Hackathon.

### Langfuse Integration: A Major Milestone

The week began with a focus on integrating Langfuse into our localization service. After studying my teammate's code and overcoming some initial hurdles with dependencies and credentials, I successfully implemented the integration. It's incredibly satisfying to see traces from localization requests appearing in the Langfuse UI. This integration allows us to track basic information about models, costs, prompts, inputs, and outputs, providing valuable insights into our AI operations.

The success of this integration is a significant achievement for me. It not only demonstrates my growing understanding of our project's architecture but also showcases my ability to implement new technologies effectively.

### Hackathon Adventure: Introducing "Trippy"

From Tuesday to Thisday, I dove headfirst into Expedia's hackathon, collaborating with a fantastic team including Danil, Gavin, Wassim, and James, four others interns. Our project, "Trippy" is an innovative travel planning application that combines the simplicity of Tinder-style swiping with the power of AI-driven recommendations. But as I said before, I’ll likely share more about it in an other post.

### End of the week

As we await the hackathon results, I'm incredibly proud of what our team accomplished in such a short time. This experience has not only sharpened my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work collaboratively under pressure.

Looking ahead to next week, I'm excited to potentially start work on a RAG project related to our localization service that would help providing more context to translations requests, pending approval from my navigator and manager.
