## My First Week as a SWE Intern at Expedia: Diving into the World of Travel Tech

I have officilly started my journey as a SWE Intern at Expedia on May 20th and I'm really excited to share my experience and learnings for the following weeks! I must recognize that I feel some pressure on my shoulders about it because I have never made any software development in my life. I am a ML student at Polytechnique Montr√©al so Python is really all I needed during those 2 years. 

### The first tasks 

The week kicked off with the essential onboarding tasks. I set up my work computer and environment, installed the necessary tools and software, and dove into the company documentation. Expedia has a well-structured onboarding process for interns, including guides on various topics and learning session with employees. I had a lot of courses and tasks to complete before the beginning of the second week. The "Hello World!" guide was clearly one of the most important and I have just learned so much with it! Everything about the developement process and the CI/CD pipeline I will use for the next months. 

### Overcome lack of experience

Towards the end of the week, I realized I needed to brush up on some technologies that are central to Expedia's tech stack but weren't part of my university curriculum. I started courses on Kotlin and Spring Boot, two technologies I hadn't worked with before. My only prior experience with Java was a brief introduction two years ago at Supaero, so diving into Kotlin and Spring Boot has been both challenging and exciting. To be honest, I was a little bit scared about it. I never touched any software development before, Spring Boot, Maven, Kotlin, CI\CD, Kafka, ... It was like a whirlwind of unknown things in which I was drowning. But everything was fine, given the tremendous amount of things I was learning through the guides and exercises I was doing. I even found myself working a bit over the weekend, though I've realized the importance of maintaining a work-life balance and plan to keep my work within weekday hours moving forward.

As I look ahead to the coming weeks, I'm eager to apply what I've learned and dive deeper into real projects. The learning curve is steep, but the supportive environment at Expedia and the wealth of resources available make me confident that I'll be able to contribute meaningfully to the team soon.
