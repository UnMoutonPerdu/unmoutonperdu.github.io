	<p>Hi ! I'm Hugo, a french student currently working on my double degree at Polytechnique Montreal.</p>
	<p>This blog was just an idea that popped into my head one night and so I decided to build it and put some stuff on it. In fact, it keeps me busy on nights when I don't know what to do... </p>
	<p>By the way I use Astro and Tailwind CSS to build this website. All my posts are written in Markdown and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
