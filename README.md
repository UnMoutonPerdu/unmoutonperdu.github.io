# Blog 

Purple Rain is the blog I've been working on for a while now, where I post a bit of everything that comes into my head. It keeps me busy on nights when I don't know what to do. 

This blog is built using Astro and the Tailwind CSS framework. Every posts are written in Markdown, and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
